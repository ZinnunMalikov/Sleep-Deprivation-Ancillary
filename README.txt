The "Sleep-Deprivation-Ancillary" repository is divided into three branches: main, gh-pages, images. To navigate through the branches, click on the drop-down menu next to the branch icon. The Jupyter notebook titled "Final_Sleep_Research_Data_Analysis.ipynb" can be found in the main branch. It may take time to open it, so it is recommended to open the "ancillary.md" file in the gh-pages branch. The link to the file is: https://github.com/ZinnunMalikov/Sleep-Deprivation-Ancillary/blob/gh-pages/ancillary.md

If the images do not load on the "ancillary.md" file, click on the following link to visit the google colab notebook. You will have to run each code segment sequentially to see the charts: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gWSBiv42LavWE4UooIHMUDz560gIbvlB?usp=sharing
